                    <h3>Track & Cross Country</h3>
                    <p>
                        <em class="highlight">Sub-four minute miler. Division I All-American. Ivy League champion.</em> Track is a huge part of my life — I commit 30+ hours a week to training and competition while maintaining a rigorous course load. I'm also a Princeton University record holder in the 600m. Running has given me lifelong friends and instilled values like discipline, teamwork, and coachability.

                    <h3>Photography</h3>
                    <p>
                        I've been into photography ever since my Dad let me borrow his old Nikon D5100. I enjoy shooting natural landscapes, wildlife, and action shots.

                    <h3>Surfing</h3>
                    <p>
                        My Dad is an avid surfer and taught me how to conquer the Jersey Shore waves from a young age. I love to hit the waves whenever possible — even in the dead of winter.
